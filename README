1) USAGE
  pwdGen is a simpel bash script. to run it you  need to 
make the source file executable. you can achieve that by
running the following command on your terminal:
	$ chmod +x <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>/pwdgen

now you can run the script simply by calling it:
	$ bash <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>/pwdgen
if you surrently are in the same path as pwdgen file:
	$ ./pwdgen
	OR
	$ bash pwdgen

  it then asks you for 3 parameter. a FIXED string, and 
two numbers. the FIXED string can be simply a name or
something that your are sure to remember it. it can be
your name but try to be a little Creative about that ;)
now this script will create a very long (44 chars) coded
string including numbers and characters (both uppercase and
lower case). 

  the first number indicates where to cut this coded string
and the second string indicates how much character you need.
you have to remember this two numbers along with your name 
(case sensetive).

TIP: you can use different numbers for different accounts
you are creating this passwords for. but be aware that the
sum of your two numbers must be exceed 49 (LIMITED).

2) LICENSE
  pwdgen is developed under GPL v3.0 or later. if dont know
what is it or like to know more, visit this URL:
	http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt
or read the 'gpl-3.0.txt' file that should be in the same
path as this script is.

3) TODOs
	* it would be nicer to get the FIXED STRING like
	it is a password so anyone near the monitor can not 
	be able to see what you are typing.
